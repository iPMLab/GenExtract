# About GenExtract (GE)
GE is a dual network extraction application to MpNM(https://github.com/iPMLab/Multi-physics-Network-Model) written in Python, which is developed by Zhejiang University and Imperial College London. In addition to standard network model using a single pore network (e.g. generated by pnextract developed by Imperial College London), GE can link two networks (e.g. pore network and solid network dual-network model) to simulated coupled mass and heat transfer in both pore space and solid phase. This model is compatible with the pore network extraction algorithm developed by Imperial College London (https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/pnextract). The source code is being prepared into different modules and will be uploaded continuously with the example datasets for demonstration.
